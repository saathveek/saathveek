## 👋 Hi there! I'm Saathveek Gowrishankar

I'm a Computer Engineering & Data Science student passionate about improving systems that make a real difference in the world.
I get especially excited about applying my skills to solve real-world challenges. If it’s clever, useful, and helps people - I’m interested :)

### 🔬 What I'm Exploring

- 📈 **ML Forecasting**: Building distributed capacity planning systems that help teams better anticipate resource needs ahead of surges
- 🎯 **TinyML**: Running embedded keyword spotting on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to enable intuitive voice commands for various technologies - hopefully including assistive robots!
- 🧠 **Human-Centered AI**: Modeling trust dynamics with assistive robots to improve adoption among older adults

### 🌱 Outside of Code

I've led initiatives and now mentor student leaders at [Engineers Without Borders UIUC](https://ewbuiuc.org), where we're working on engineering projects to build sustainable infrastructure in communities around the world.
In my free time, I'm usually baking (cupcakes are the current obsession), playing pickleball with friends, or plotting my next trip... I've visited 20+ countries so far, but I'm always looking for any chance to explore more cultures and their cuisines.

### ⚡ Fun Fact

I’ve run keyword spotting models on a microcontroller smaller than my thumb and deployed forecasting models for mainframes thousands of times larger.

Also... I strongly believe that *anything* is better than buttercream frosting - change my mind.
